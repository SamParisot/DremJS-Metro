    <h2>Version: 0.0.4a</h2>
    <p>Note: If something isn't right with your desktop, try reloading the frame! If that doesn't work, clear your browsers cache!</p>
    <p>Another Note: When loading an app or clicking the Start button, flickering is normal. This is just because the IFrame is loading the application.</p>
    <p>Changelog:<p>
    <p>Version 0.0.4a</p>
    <p>+Sam&Yoe Group: The Video Game</p>
    <p>  ~Music has some problems</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.3a</p>
    <p>Now for some functionality.</p>
    <p>+TinyMCE Text Editor</p>
    <p>+Paint app</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.2a</p>
    <p>+This version actually used javascript for the home button! Now DremJS really is DremJS! Seriously though, when installing web apps on this thing that don't have a home button, this button is a life saver.</p>
    <p>-All built-in apps have gotten their home buttons due to the "master" home button.</p>
    <p>-Test Apps Removed (from start menu)</p>
    <p>Version 0.0.1a</p>
    <p>The first ever version. Doesn't even have JS yet, despite the name. Don't expect much.</p>
    <p>Future ideas:</p>
    <p>To be able to go back to the home screen easier, I will soon add a home button by loading apps using iframe instead.</p>
